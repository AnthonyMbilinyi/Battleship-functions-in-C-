Here's a breakdown of key functions you might find in a C++ console-based Battleship game:
1. Game Setup & Initialization
 * createBoard():
   * Creates a 2D array (e.g., char board[10][10]) to represent the game board.
   * Initializes all board positions to empty (e.g., ' ' or '.').
 * placeShips():
   * Allows the player (and potentially the computer) to place their ships on the board.
   * Handles input validation (e.g., ship placement within bounds, no overlapping ships).
 * initializeGame():
   * Calls createBoard() for both player and computer boards.
   * Calls placeShips() for both player and computer.
2. Gameplay & Core Logic
 * getPlayerMove():
   * Prompts the player to enter their coordinates for a shot (e.g., "A1", "B5").
   * Converts player input to valid row and column indices.
 * makeMove():
   * Takes a target coordinate as input.
   * Checks the corresponding position on the opponent's board:
     * If it's an empty space, mark it as "miss" (e.g., 'o').
     * If it's a ship part, mark it as "hit" (e.g., 'x').
     * Update the game state (e.g., check for sunk ships).
 * checkWinCondition():
   * Determines if all of a player's ships have been sunk.
   * Returns true if a player has won, false otherwise.
3. Display & User Interface
 * displayBoard():
   * Prints the current state of a given game board to the console.
   * Clearly labels rows and columns (e.g., A-J, 1-10).
   * Visually represents ships, hits, and misses.
 * displayGameStatus():
   * Prints messages to the console to inform the player about their moves, hits, misses, and the overall game status.
4. Computer AI (Optional)
 * makeComputerMove():
   * Implements the AI's logic for selecting a target coordinate.
     * Simple AI: Randomly select coordinates.
     * More advanced AI: Use strategies like targeting around known hits.
5. Main Game Loop
 * playGame():
   * The main function that controls the flow of the game.
   * Calls initializeGame().
   * Repeatedly:
     * Call getPlayerMove() and makeMove().
     * Call makeComputerMove() and makeMove() (if applicable).
     * Call displayBoard() for both players.
     * Call checkWinCondition() and end the game if a player wins.
Example Code Snippet (Illustrative)
#include <iostream>
// ... other necessary headers

using namespace std;

char board[10][10]; // Example board

void createBoard() {
    // ... initialization code
}

void displayBoard() {
    // ... display code
}

int main() {
    createBoard();
    displayBoard();
    // ... rest of the game logic
    return 0;
}

Note: This is a basic outline. You'll need to implement the full logic within each function and handle various game-related aspects (input validation, error handling, etc.).
